                        <p class="role">With My Friends</p>
                        <p>A well-known spiritual location in Nepal is called Pilotbaba. It is renowned for its
                            tranquil settings, lovely temple, and dynamic culture. One can never forget the experience
                            of visiting Pailot Baba, and I had the honor of going there with my companions.The soothing
                            chimes of the temple bells and the chanting of hymns welcomed us as soon as we arrived at
                            Pilotbaba. There was calmness in the air, and the atmosphere was serene. We were mesmerized
                            by the temple's exquisite architecture and couldn't help but take pictures of it.</p>

                        <p>A hike to Nepal's Changunarayan temple is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. This historic
                            temple, one of the oldest and most renowned in Nepal, is situated on a hill in the Kathmandu
                            valley. Moreover, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, drawing tourists from all over the
                            globe.Although it's a short climb, the Changunarayan temple gives breathtaking views of the
                            valleys and hills in the area. The well-maintained trail travels past terraced farms,
                            traditional Nepalese villages, and lush forests. You will come across a number of tiny
                            temples and shrines along the ascent, each with its own special beauty and background.</p>

                        <h3>Jamacho</h3>
                        <p class="role">Hiking</p>
                        <p>When visiting Kathmandu, Nepal, outdoor enthusiasts frequently go on hikes to Jamacho. A hill
                            called Jamacho, also called Jamachowk, is situated in the Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park
                            not far from the city. The hill provides a sweeping perspective of the city and the nearby
                            Himalayan mountain ranges.Due to its steep ascent and uneven terrain, the hike to Jamacho is
                            rated moderate to hard. The trail winds its way through lush oak and rhododendron forests
                            from the national park's entrance. You will come across a number of small stupas and shrines
                            as you hike up.</p>
