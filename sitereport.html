                <p>For me, learning the fundamentals of web development—including the coding, design, and debugging
                    processes—was a thrilling experience. This help me to experience a number of ups and downs as a
                    newcomer in this profession, which helped me comprehend the complexities of web development.</p><br>
                <p>By studying the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The principles were quite simple to understand, but
                    this ran across more difficult problems. Understanding CSS was one of my main. This took me several
                    tries to completely understand the syntax and how it was used. It felt really great to see the
                    effects after I started using it on my web pages, though. The idea of designing was also new to me.
                    Always loved how websites look and wanted to learn how to design my own. It was challenging to
                    produce a design that was both practical and aesthetically pleasing. This took a lot of trial and
                    error, imagination, and patience. Another area of web programming that needed some time to master
                    was debugging. It had a lot of faults and mistakes in my code, and trying to figure out where I went
                    wrong was aggravating. Yet, I was able to effectively debug my code with the aid of online
                    resources, my colleagues, and myself. I faced several ups and downs but I persevered and learned a
                    lot along the way. Now I have a better understanding of how web pages are created and how to make
                    them visually appealing and functional. I look forward to further developing my skills and taking on
                    greater challenges in the future. At the end of this module I feel that I have learned a lot about
                    the subject and about myself. The module experience was both challenging and rewarding and I gained
                    many valuable insights. One of the most important challenges I faced during the module was effective
                    time management. The workload was heavy and I found it difficult to balance my academic duties with
                    my personal life. However, as the module progressed, I learned to manage my time more efficiently
                    and prioritize tasks effectively. The content of the module was very engaging and I enjoyed going
                    through it. The teaching methods used helped me to understand the concepts very effectively and the
                    practical exercises especially helped to strengthen the knowledge. I appreciated the opportunities
                    to collaborate with my peers, and the class discussions were always insightful and
                    thought-provoking. One of the highlights of the module was the feedback I received from my tutor.
                    The feedback was constructive and helped to find areas for improvement. I found the suggestions very
                    motivating and made me strive for excellence in my work. When designing the site, I wanted to create
                    a modern, minimalist look that would be easy for users to navigate. I chose a simple white, dark
                    grey and neon color scheme to create a clean and professional feel. The font used is sans-serif,
                    which is easy to read and modern, adding a minimalist feel to the site. I wanted to make sure the
                    text was legible and easy to read, so I chose a larger font and made sure there was good contrast
                    between the text and the background.</p><br>
                <p>In conclusion, developing the website during this period was a challenging but rewarding experience.
                    I paid close attention to both the technical and design aspects of the site's user interface and
                    made decisions that ensured the site's functional and aesthetic appearance. Opting for a minimalist
                    design, simple color scheme, easy-to-read typography and responsive layout, I created a website that
                    is modern and user-friendly. The influences I received from other websites helped me develop a clear
                    vision for the design of my website, and I believe the final result reflects that vision.</p>
